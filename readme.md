# QGIS H3 Library Helper Plugin

This plugin install a Windows version of the H3 Library into QGIS. Rather than use this plugin it is best to 'pip install h3' from the OSGeo4W console, but for those who don't have system administrator rights, this method may be beneficial. It only works with QGIS 3.20 or newer versions. It creates a menu in "Plugins->H3 Status->About" which gives information about whether H3 was sucessfully installed or not.

The H3 library is used by the Density Analysis and Lat Lon Tools plugins.
